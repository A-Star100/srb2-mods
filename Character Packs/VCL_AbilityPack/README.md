[View official trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWz0-E3x7ow&ab_channel=SonicTurbo)

A character pack containg three characters! **Blue Blur**, **Sly Tails**, and **Muscles Knuckles**!
These were my first three character mods.

## Blue Blur

- **Boost Mode:** Build up enough speed and- BOOM! You'll go BLAZING fast and your speed and jump height'll just keep on increasing as you go! Endless speedrunning possibilities!

- **Multi Thok:** The multi thok from the old days of SRB2 is back in action! Topped with Boost Mode you've got a speedy guy right here.

- **Hydro Dash:** A regular speed thok, right? But it doesn't slow down underwater! Use it with Custom 1 to ***speeeeed*** through those long, drawn out underwater segments! Credit to [this script](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/everyone-gets-a-thok.27956/).
  
- **Dropdash:** The dropdash returns from Sonic Mania! Press spin or Custom 2 in mid-air and boost on landing!

  ### BattleMod Abilities (from ChrispyChars, experimental)

  Provided you added the patch file, here it is:

  - **Super Dash Attack (On-Ground):** A mini-catapult that smacks your enemies' faces based on the Super Spin Attack!
  - **Super Spin Bounce (Mid-Air):** Bounce hard on top of your enemies to attack them!

## Sly Tails

- **Catapult:** By pressing spin on the ground, you'll launch into a stealthy arc that can skip unnecessary chunks of levels, but spamming it's no fun, isn't it?

- **Air Drill:** Don't wanna waste time? Go ***high*** up in a forwards and upwards arc with Custom 1!

- **Wall Busting:** You can also bust through the same walls that normally only Knuckles and Muscles Knuckles can!

## Muscles Knuckles

- **Knockback:** A SLAM to the ground that lets you bounce off of enemies!

- **Strike Dash:** A short-range dash that hits enemies hard with Custom 1!

- **Stomp Damage:** Even if you're not curled up into a ball, Muscles's, well, y'know, muscles, will destroy anything in his way, and jumpscare those puny enemies!

## Blue Blur (Super Form)

- **Speed Boost:** The Blur becomes **much** faster in his Super form! Use it to **BLAZE** through every stage at his **highest speeds**!
  
- **Air Run:** When he's in Super, the dropdash gets replaced with the Air Run ability! Hover across landscapes and buildings as you enjoy the mesmerizing sights!

# Team Blur
The 3 heroes join together along with one extra fellow and team up to the best of their abilities!

- **Char. Swap:** Just like in [BuddyEx](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/buddyex.30566/), use Weapon Next. or Weapon Prev. to swap between heroes in a flashy fashion!

- **Dummy:** The new guy, Dummy, serves as a copy of Sonic. His purpose, is well, techinical difficulties (literally). But us adding him as a feature is a unique perk for you for many reasons! But first and foremost, you can prank your friends with this seemingly mysterious character.
