A character pack containg three characters! **Blue Blur**, **Sly Tails**, and **Muscles Knuckles**!
These were my first three character mods.

**Works best with SRB2 v2.2.10+**.

## Blue Blur

- **Boost Mode:** Build up enough speed and- BOOM! You'll go BLAZING fast and your speed and jump height'll just keep on increasing as you go! Endless speedrunning possibilities!

- **Multi Thok:** The multi thok from the old days of SRB2 is back in action! Topped with Boost Mode you've got a speedy guy right here.

- **Hydro Dash:** A regular speed thok, right? But it doesn't slow down underwater! Use it with Custom 1 to ***speeeeed*** through those long, drawn out underwater segments! Credit to [this script](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/everyone-gets-a-thok.27956/).
  
- **Dropdash:** The dropdash returns from Sonic Mania! Press spin or Custom 2 in mid-air and boost on landing! It also twists up gameplay when you use your shield ability!

  ### BattleMod Abilities (from ChrispyChars, experimental)

  Provided you added the patch file, here it is:

  - **Super Dash Attack (On-Ground):** A mini-catapult that smacks your enemies' faces based on the Super Spin Attack!
  - **Super Spin Bounce (Mid-Air):** Bounce hard on top of your enemies to attack them!

## Sly Tails

- **Catapult:** By pressing spin on the ground, you'll launch into a stealthy arc that can skip unnecessary chunks of levels, but spamming it's no fun, isn't it? | **PRO TIP:** Press Custom 2 while catapulting to lose less speed when you land and move around more freely in mid-air.

- **Spindash:** By holding Custom 2 and pressing spin, you'll do an ordinary spindash. 

- **Air Drill:** Don't wanna waste time? Go ***high*** up in a forwards and upwards arc with Custom 1!

## Muscles Knuckles

- **Knockback:** A SLAM to the ground that lets you bounce off of enemies!

- **Strike Dash:** A short-range dash that hits enemies hard with Custom 1!

- **Homing Smash:** By holding Custom 3 and double jumping, you'll do a homing attack/thok. Note that this won't work too well when you're Super.

## Super Blur

- **Speed Boost:** The Blur becomes **much** faster in his Super form! Use it to **BLAZE** through every stage at his **second-highest speeds**!
  
- **Hover:** When he's in Super, double-jump and you'll hover in mid-air. Press Custom 1 while in mid-air to add a cool trail from behind.
  
- **Hover Dash:** The dropdash becomes the Hover Dash here! When Hovering, press Jump+Spin at the same time to receive a HUGE boost forward! Don't worry, you can still dropdash when you're no longer hovering though. (though it is kind of uncontrollable and you lose some rings upon doing it, not too many though).

## Hyper Blur
To become Hyper Blur, all you've gotta do is be Super Blur and have more than 100 rings, then... press Custom 3 (on the ground or in the air). He has the same abilities as Super Blur and some more!

- **HYPER Speed Boost:** The Blur becomes **EVEN** faster in his Hyper form! Use it to **SKIM** through every stage at his **highest speeds**!

- **Nuke Thrust:** Press Custom 3 on the ground once you're Hyper Blur to nuke enemies around you. It'll also give you a short boost upwards. It can also attack bosses and enemies above you, as long as you're close enough to it.

# Team Blur (Experimental)
The 3 heroes join together along with one extra fellow and team up to the best of their abilities!

- **Char. Swap:** Just like in [BuddyEx](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/buddyex.30566/), use Weapon Next. or Weapon Prev. to swap between heroes like never before!

- **Dummy:** The new guy, Dummy, serves as a copy of Sonic. His purpose, is well, techinical difficulties (literally). But, you can prank people in servers with it!
