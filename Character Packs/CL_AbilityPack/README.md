# AbilityChars

A character pack containg three characters! **Blue Blur**, **Sly Tails**, and **Muscles Knuckles**!

These were my first three character mods.

## Blue Blur

- **Boost Mode:** Build up enough speed and- BOOM! You'll go BLAZING fast and your speed and jump height'll just keep on increasing as you go! Endless speedrunning possibilities!

- **Multi Thok:** The multi thok from the old days of SRB2 is back in action! Topped with Boost Mode you've got a speedy guy right here.

- **Hydro Dash:** A regular speed thok, right? But it doesn't slow down underwater! Use it with Custom 1 to ***speeeeed*** through those long, drawn out underwater segments!

## Sly Tails

- **Catapult:** By pressing spin on the ground, you'll launch into a stealthy arc that can skip unnecessary chunks of levels, but spamming its no fun, isn't it?

- **Strike Dash:** A speedy, short-range dash that hits enemies hard with Custom 1!

- **Wall Busting:** You can also bust through the same walls that normally only Knuckles and Muscles Knuckles can!

## Muscles Knuckles

- **Air Drill:** Don't wanna waste time? Go ***high*** up in a forwards and upwards arc mid-glide or not with Custom 1!

- **Stomp Damage:** Even if you're not curled up into a ball, Muscles's, well, y'know, muscles, will destroy anything in his way, and jumpscare those puny enemies!
