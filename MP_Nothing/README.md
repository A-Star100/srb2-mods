# MP_Nothing
A collection of gametypes for multiplayer, all daunting!

## Nothing Mode
No rings, springs, not even bosses are here to stop you! We hope you'll make it!

## Ultimate Mode
Back from single-player is this devastating gametype! No rings, one life, and **SUPER OBNOXIOUS!!!**

## Easy Mode
For those who want an easy game, you've got no enemies! But bosses are still here though, unlike in Nothing Mode, where **nothing**
is the challenge!
