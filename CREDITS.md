### Thanks to:
- FoxBot mod for the bots in the [Team Blur](https://github.com/A-Star100/srb2-mods/tree/main/Character%20Packs/VCL_AbilityPack#team-blur-experimental) mod (not ExAI or BuddyEx, just foxBot, which is based on ExAI)
- David's PK3Char template; Really helped with spritework and even the Boost ability, since this was my first character mod I had never heard of SF_DASHMODE at the time

- EveryoneGetsAThok mod for the Hydro Dash and Strike Dash
- Neo Sonic mod for that yellow highlight code in the SOC_PLAY file (previously)
