# Muscles Knuckles
A spin on the iconic Knuckles The Echidna of SRB2. He has 2 unique abilities:

- **Air Drill:** Press Jump in mid-air and you will go forwards and upwards at the same time in an arc. Pressing Spin makes you descend faster in the middle of an Air Drill.

- **Stomp Damage:** Damage enemies by landing on them, regardless of your vulnerability. (this means that even if you are standing instead of curled up into a ball landing on enemies still damages them instead of you).
