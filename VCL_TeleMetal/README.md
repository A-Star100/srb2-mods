# Tele Metal
**Tele Metal** is a specialized version of Metal Sonic.

- **Speed Thok:**
Press Custom 1 in mid-air to perform one of Sonic's speed thoks! (Credit to [this mod](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/everyone-gets-a-thok.27956/) for the speed thok code).

- **Dropdash:** 
The dropdash returns from Sonic Mania! Press spin in mid-air and boost on landing!

- **Telekinesis:**
Pressing the jump button a second time in mid-air will push enemies and players close to you away.
Pressing Spin in mid-air pulls them towards you instead.

**Tip:** Telekinesis works best near many enemies.

**BattleMod abilities are the same as Blue Blur's**.
