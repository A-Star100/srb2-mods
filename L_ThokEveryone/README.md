# ThokEveryone
This Lua script is a modification of CobaltBW's Lua script tutorial for thokking, but this time, you can thok with every base-game character that has a spinning animation when 
jumping (this means that Tails, Knuckles, and Metal Sonic can also thok now with this mod).
You can find the original Lua [here](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/lua-thok-scripting-example.30555/).

## Description
Ever wanted characters other than Sonic to be able to thok? Well now you can with ThokEveryone! Now every character, from the high-flying Tails to the strong-as-heck Knuckles 
can now thok wherever they want to, and if applied, they can even multi-thok with the MultiThokEveryone mod!

And guess what! **This mod works in 2.1 as well as 2.2!**.
