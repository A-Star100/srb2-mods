# ThokEveryone
This Lua script is a modification of CobaltBW's Lua script tutorial for thokking, but this time, you can thok with most characters (including modded ones) that have a proper jump ability (this excludes Amy and Fang but includes Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Metal Sonic, and most mods).

| Character | Compatibility |
|------------|------------------
| Tails          | ✅ Good        |
| Knuckles   | ✅ Good   |
| Metal Sonic | ✅ Good        | 
| X Sonic | ❌ Nothing Works  | 
| Modern Sonic | ❌ Nothing Works  |

This mod is compatible with most other mods that don't have advanced abilities that overwrite special ability changes. X Sonic and Modern Sonic have been tested and don't work, but 
a wide range of other mods do.

You can find CobaltBW's original Lua [here](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/lua-thok-scripting-example.30555/).

## Description
Ever wanted characters other than Sonic to be able to thok? Well now you can with ThokEveryone! Now every character, from the high-flying Tails to most modded characters
can now thok and multi-thok wherever they want to!

And guess what! **This mod works in 2.1 as well as 2.2!***.

**There are some bugs in 2.1 that don't occur in 2.2, but for the most part the mod still works in 2.1.*
