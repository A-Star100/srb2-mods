# ThokEveryone
[View the official trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHy7Z256abY).

This Lua script is a modification of CobaltBW's Lua script tutorial for thokking, but this time, you can thok with most characters (including modded ones) that don't override special abilities forcefully.

| Character | Compatibility |
|------------|------------------
| Tails          | ✅ Good        |
| Knuckles   | ✅ Good   |
| Metal Sonic | ✅ Good        | 
| X Sonic | ❌ Thok Fails  | 
| Modern Sonic | ✅ Good  |
| SMSReborn | ✅ Good  |
| AbilityChars | ✅ Good  |
| Adventure Sonic | ✅ Good  |
| Werehog | ✅ OK, slightly broken  |

This mod is compatible with most other mods that don't have advanced abilities that overwrite special ability changes. X Sonic and Modern Sonic have been tested and don't work, but 
a wide range of other mods do.

You can find CobaltBW's original Lua [here](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/lua-thok-scripting-example.30555/).

## Description
Ever wanted characters other than Sonic to be able to thok? Well now you can with ThokEveryone! Now every character, from the high-flying Tails to most modded characters
can now thok and multi-thok wherever they want to!

## SRB2 v2.1 Bugs
In 2.2, we have finally fixed the bug where thokking into enemies damages you via `ThinkFrame`. However this method doesn't work in 2.1 and
there aren't easy ways to replicate it.

We've added comments to the mod that guide you on how to make the mod work in 2.1.
