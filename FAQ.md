# FAQ
## Can I use anything from this mod in my project?
Of course!

## Is it okay if I don't make any changes to the mod and redistribute it?
Then there really isn't a point. Playing with it or making noticeable changes is a game-changer for a certain audience,
but just cloning the mod and putting it out publicly doesn't add any value.

## Is this mod considered Open Assets?
Yeah. It uses a lot of things from other **Open Assets** mods, which means according to the SRB2 MB's terms, it must be Open Assets as well.
