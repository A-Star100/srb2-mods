# Sly Tails
A unique spin on the iconic Miles Tails Prower in SRB2.

He has 2 unique abilities, along with Tails's except the spindash:

- **Catapult:** By pressing the Spin key when on the ground, he can thrust forwards with a huge speed boost, but once he reaches his destination all speed drops. Useful for crossing large gaps.
- **Bust Walls:** Thought Knuckles was the only one strong enough? Well, Sly Tails can also bust through walls that normally only Knuckles can!
