# Sly Tails
A unique spin on the iconic Miles Tails Prower in SRB2.

He has 3 unique abilities:

- **Multi Thok:** Just like Speedy Sonic, he can spam Sonic's signature speed thok, but he has to do it mid-jump with the Spin button, so he can no longer spindash (but still fly, thankfully).
- **Catapult:** By pressing the Spin key when on the ground, he can thrust forwards with a huge speed boost, but once he reaches his destination all speed drops. Useful for crossing large gaps.
- **Bust Walls:** Thought Knuckles was the only one strong enough? Well, Sly Tails can also bust through walls that normally only Knuckles can!
