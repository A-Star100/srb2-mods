# Kart Speedy
The speedy-as-heck **Speedy Sonic** from vanilla SRB2 returns to **SRB2 Kart** and **Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers**!

Kart Speedy provides a balance of weight *and* speed while still being faster than the others to help *you* win in netgames and time attack!

Not much to write home about regarding abilities, but make sure that you stop a bit in tight corners, it helps to effectively control the speed while still being able to boost ahead later!
