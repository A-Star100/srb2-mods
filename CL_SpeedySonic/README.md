# Speedy Sonic
[View official trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WBq-iaOaGc).

My first character mod for SRB2, created from this [template](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/pk3-file-template.40272/)! (Thank you **very much**, David, for making the template, I cannot express my gratitude).

Speedy Sonic has 2 major abilities:

- **Boost:** Keep running fast enough and blaze through stages at incredible speeds! The longer you go the faster you get! But be warned! If at any time you stop, the boost will end!
- **Multithok:** Chain Sonic's signature speed thoks in a crazy, broken frenzy! (I used the code from the MultiThokEveryone mod, also by me!).

He can also turn Super!
