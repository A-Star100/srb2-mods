# Speedy Sonic
[View the official trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WBq-iaOaGc).

My first character mod for SRB2, created from this [template](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/pk3-file-template.40272/)! (Thanks, David, for making the template!).

Speedy Sonic is slightly faster than vanilla Sonic but still controllable like him, as well as having 2 new abilities:

- **Boost:** Keep running fast enough and blaze through stages at incredible speeds! The longer you go the faster you get! But be warned! If at any time you stop, or get hit by an enemy, the boost will end!
- **Multithok:** Chain Sonic's signature speed thoks in a crazy, broken frenzy! (I used the code from the MultiThokEveryone mod, also by me!).

He can also turn Super!
