# How to Play
Speedy Sonic is a powerful character that can finish levels and races in **seconds** with the right precision.

## Boost 
Keep on running and running until you hear a sound and Speedy starts to flash. Once he does, he will get faster and faster as you keep running in this state without getting slowed down or hit by enemies/obstacles. In this state he can also run on water.
Combined with a spindash and multiple speed thoks, this can **easily be used as a catapult** to win in boss battles and races, and to finish levels in record time.

## Multi-Thok
SRB2's original Sonic's speed thok ability sure is a good one! But Speedy Sonic has the ability to speed thok **multiple times!**
There's no limit! Speed thok to your will! It's best to chain speed thoks only in straight paths, though, otherwise use one speed thok.

## Super Speedy
With all 7 Chaos Emeralds and at least 50 rings, pressing the Spin button in mid-air transforms you into **Super Speedy!** In this state,
each and every one of his abilities becomes **TWICE** as fast. As Super Speedy, you can **CRUSH** those challenges, including the infamous **Metal Sonic race!**

## More
Note that none of these abilities will be usable if you are in game modes that disable special abilities like Capture The Flag, which when you are holding the flag both Speedy's boost and multi-thok are disabled (we have no control over this).

Hope you enjoy playing as **Speedy Sonic!**

**Gotta go fast!**
