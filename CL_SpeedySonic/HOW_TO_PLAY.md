# How to Play
Speedy Sonic is a powerful character that can finish levels and races in **seconds** with the right precision.

## Boost 
Keep on running and running until you hear a sound and Speedy starts to flash. Once he does, he will get faster and faster as you keep running in this state without getting slowed down or hit by enemies/obstacles. In this state he can also run on water.
Combined with a spindash and multiple speed thoks, this can easily be used as a catapult to win in boss battles and races, and to finish levels in record time.

## Multi-Thok
SRB2's original Sonic's speed thok ability sure is a good one! But Speedy Sonic has the ability to speed thok **multiple times**! 
There's no limit! Speed thok to your will! It's best to chain speed thoks only in straight paths, though, otherwise use one speed thok.

## Super Speedy
With all 7 Chaos Emeralds and at least 50 rings, Speedy Sonic can become **Super Speedy!**. In this state,
each and every one of his abilities becomes **TWICE** as fast. As Super Speedy, you can **CRUSH** those challenges, including the infamous **Metal Sonic race!**

Hope you enjoy playing as **Speedy Sonic!**

**Gotta go fast!**.
