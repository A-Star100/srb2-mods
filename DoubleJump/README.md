# DoubleJump
An extremely simple WAD file that uses P_SKIN files to allow vanilla characters to double jump.
**This mod does NOT work with modded characters, only vanilla ones**.

(Credit to [Sonic R Abilities](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/sonic-r-abilities.30509/) for the idea of how this WAD works).
