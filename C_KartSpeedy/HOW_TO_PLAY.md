# How to Play
Kart Speedy doesn't have many abilities. They're all the same as vanilla Sonic from these kart racer games. This is mostly due to limitations with how these games work. Vanilla
SRB2 allows for heavy customization of your mods, so we took advantage of that. But these kart racer games mostly leave everything to themselves, and the best selling point about mods
made for those games is their custom skins or slight gameplay changes that can change how you experience the storyline.

In short, playing as Speedy in these games is the same as playing as Sonic in these games, only with different speed and weight values under the hood.
